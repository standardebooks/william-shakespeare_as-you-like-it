									<span>They have their exits and their entrances;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And one man in his time plays many parts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Seeking the bubble reputation</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That ends this strange eventful history,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</span>
